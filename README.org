  Terminal user interface for simulations. Just run your software as

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  ./termsim your_program your_arg1 your_arg2 your_args
  #+END_SRC

  ~termsim~ will read ~stdout~ and ~stderr~ and will update the
  scatterplot or the message area depending on the beginning of the
  sentence.

** Syntax

   To plot the points ~(0,0,1)~, ~(4,5,6)~ and ~(4,4,7)~, the program
   running under termsim should output something along the lines of

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
    print("DATA")
    print("0 0 1")
    print("4 5 6")
    print("4 4 7")
    print("END")
   #+END_SRC

   where each print statement adds a newline.

   To add a message, just print it, anything that doesn't begin with
   ~DATA~ will be treated as a message. ~stderr~ will be merged with
   ~stdout~ and parsed also by ~termsim~.

   Termsim will apply colors to statements starting by ~Error:~,
   ~Warning:~ and ~Info:~.
